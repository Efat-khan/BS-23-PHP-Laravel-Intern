What is Composer?
Composer is a tool for managing PHP packages (external libraries) and also helps load classes automatically using autoloading.

Think of Composer as an app store for PHP packages. Instead of manually downloading and including files, Composer does it for you.

What is Autoloading?
Autoloading means PHP automatically loads classes when needed, so you donâ€™t have to manually include (require) files. As previously we do in namespaces.

What is PSR-4 Autoloading?
PSR-4 is a standard that defines how PHP classes and namespaces should be organized so that Composer can automatically load them.

ðŸ”¹ PSR-4 Rule:
A namespace (MyApp\Models) maps to a folder structure (src/Models).
