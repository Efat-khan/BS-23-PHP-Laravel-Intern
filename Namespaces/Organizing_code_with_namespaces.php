<!-- Namespaces in PHP
A namespace in PHP is like a folder for organizing your code. It helps to avoid name conflicts when multiple classes or functions have the same name.
Need Namespaces:
Imagine you are using two different libraries, and both have a User class. Without namespaces, PHP wouldn't know which User class to use. Namespaces solve this problem by grouping classes into unique names.
